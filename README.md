"An open-source economic operating system built for an automated future."

How this Repo Connects to the Book
This repository is the technical companion to the Abundance Dividend Framework (ADF) book series hosted on Substack.  
While the book explores the narrative, history, and social implications of a post-scarcity economy, this GitHub repository serves as the "Economic Operating System". Here, we translate abstract economic theories into:  
• Logic Flowcharts: Visualizing the "if/then" of resource distribution.  
• Pseudo-code & Python Scripts: Testing variables like automation taxes and universal dividends in a simulated environment.  
• Open-Source Contribution: Providing a space where economists, coders, and the community can debate, fork, and refine the framework's logic in real-time.  
We aren't just writing words; we are writing code. This ensures that the ADF is not just a theory, but a functional blueprint for an automated future.
