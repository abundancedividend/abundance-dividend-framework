Contributing to the Abundance Dividend Framework (ADF)
Thank you for your interest in building an open-source economic operating system. This project is "Built in Public," and we value the input of economists, developers, and visionaries.  
How You Can Help
We are looking for contributions in the following areas:
• Logic Refinement: Reviewing the economic "if/then" logic for potential flaws or "logic branches".  
• Technical Implementation: Helping translate narrative chapters into Python scripts or MermaidJS flowcharts.  
• Data Visualization: Helping visualize the equations and variables discussed in the framework.  
• Clarity: Fixing typos or suggesting better ways to explain complex economic variables.  
The Process
1. Check the "Issues" Tab: Look for tasks tagged with good first issue to get started.  
2. Submit a Pull Request: If you have a fix or a logic branch, submit it for review.  
3. Join the Debate: Use the "Discussions" or "Issues" tab to provide counter-points to current ADF theory.
